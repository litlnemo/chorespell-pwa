# ChoreSpell
A random chore app (in progress).

Because sometimes it's easier just to do something random when you have a spare 5 minutes or half an hour. At least, for those of us with questionable executive function!

This app is actually a website that acts like an app. It stores all your chores in local storage on your device, and doesn't keep stats or anything like that -- no login required -- so it's totally private!

## To use

Go to [the app](https://litlnemo.github.io/chorespell-pwa/) in a browser on your device. Tap the Share icon (on iOS) or the three dots in the top right corner of your browser window (on Android). Then choose "Add to Home Screen" (you might have to scroll down to find it). It will then put the "app" on your home screen and you won't have to go through a browser to use it!

## Warning

Use the backup feature, just in case! As long as you don't delete the app from your home screen and then re-add it, your chores should stay intact -- but to be safe, if you have a lot of chores, it's best to back them up. Because typing all of them again would suck.
